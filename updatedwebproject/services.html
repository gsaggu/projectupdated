			generally follows six major stages that you should think through before crafting your final project planning and 
			proposal documents(Site definition and planning , Information architecture, Site design, Site construction, Site marketing
            Tracking, evaluation, and maintenance). Developing a large web site is a process that may have far-reaching budgetary, 
			personnel, and public relations consequences for an organization, both during the development of the site and long 
			after its deployment.
